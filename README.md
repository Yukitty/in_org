ORG Player v1.07
================
Looking for binaries? See the [releases page](https://github.com/Yukitty/in_org/releases).
**To use:** Just put *in_org.dll* into your `/WinAmp/Plugins/` folder, then open organya data in *WinAmp*.

Released for free and open source under the WTFPL, see [COPYING](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yukitty/in_org/master/COPYING) for full license information.

**Hidden feature:** To play beta tracks with the most common beta drumset, change the file's internal header from Org-02 to Org-01.

The Japanese OrgMaker 2 drum set is not supported at the moment, but the English version is available under Org-02 as normal due to no conflicts in instrument numbering.
